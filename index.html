            Dense Subgraph Discovery (DSD) is a central problem in the field of graph mining and network analysis, which involves identifying subgraphs that exhibit a high level of connectivity or interaction among their vertices. Dense subgraphs are fundamental in many real-world applications, such as detecting cohesive communities in social networks, identifying protein complexes in biological networks, and summarizing large graphs for visualization and indexing purposes. However, the DSD problem is computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible subgraphs, especially when considering dense structures like cliques.

            These datasets cover a wide range of domains including biology, computer networks, and scientific collaboration, and range from medium-sized graphs with thousands of edges to large graphs with over a hundred thousand edges.

            This assignment focuses on implementing two key algorithms proposed in the paper Efficient Algorithms for Densest Subgraph Discovery by Fang et al., namely Algorithm-1 (Exact) and Algorithm-4 (CoreExact). Both algorithms employ network flow methods but differ in how they construct the search space and prune unnecessary computations. The goal of the assignment is to understand the working principles behind these algorithms, implement them in C/C++, and test them on various real-world datasets to analyze their efficiency and accuracy.

          <p class="card-text">
            The Exact algorithm is a traditional method that finds the densest subgraph of a given graph by solving a sequence of maximum flow problems. The key idea is to perform a binary search on the possible density values of subgraphs. In each iteration of the binary search, the algorithm constructs a flow network based on the current guess of the density threshold α. If the minimum s-t cut in the flow network suggests that there exists a subgraph with density greater than α, the lower bound of the search interval is increased; otherwise, the upper bound is decreased.

          <h3 class="card-title">Algorithm Overview</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            The flow network construction involves creating nodes for every vertex and every (h-1)-clique instance, in addition to source and sink nodes. Edges are added between the source and vertices, vertices and sink, vertices and cliques, and cliques back to vertices, with carefully assigned capacities based on the degree and the current guess α. By computing the minimum cut, the algorithm checks whether a feasible subgraph exists above the threshold.

        <h2>Algorithm 4 : Core Exact</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="card-title">Brief Description</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            To address the inefficiencies in Exact, the CoreExact algorithm introduces several crucial optimizations that dramatically improve runtime without losing exactness. The main idea is to first decompose the graph into (k,Ψ)-cores — generalized core structures based on clique participation rather than mere degrees. Using the core decomposition, the algorithm can localize the densest subgraph to much smaller regions of the graph.

        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="card-title">Algorithm Overview</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            Initially, CoreExact computes the (k,Ψ)-core decomposition and finds a tighter lower bound on the optimal density by examining the densest residual cores. The search is then restricted to smaller connected components induced by higher-core vertices. In each binary search iteration, instead of constructing a flow network over the entire graph, CoreExact only builds the network over the currently considered core or component, leading to much faster min-cut computations.
            Additionally, as the binary search progresses and the density lower bound increases, CoreExact dynamically adjusts the working component to even denser cores, further shrinking the search space. This results in flow networks becoming progressively smaller, significantly accelerating the convergence of the binary search.

            all test datasets. Execution times are provided in seconds for easier
            quantitative comparison. The CoreExact algorithm consistently outperforms the Exact algorithm.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            When analyzing efficiency, a clear trend emerges. CoreExact consistently achieved lower execution times compared to Algorithm-1, reducing runtime by approximately 30% to 45% across all datasets tested. This improvement was achieved without any compromise on the accuracy of the output. The reduction in execution time can be attributed to the core decomposition strategy employed by CoreExact, which allowed the algorithm to focus only on the denser portions of the graph, thereby minimizing the size of the flow networks needed at each stage of the binary search.

            The comparative analysis also reveals significant differences in scalability between the two algorithms. As the size of the input graphs increased, the performance advantage of CoreExact became more pronounced. While Algorithm-1 performed acceptably on small and medium-sized networks, its execution time grew rapidly with larger graphs. CoreExact, by contrast, demonstrated much better scalability, making it particularly suitable for very large graphs such as those representing Internet topologies or large biological datasets. The ability of CoreExact to prune low-density regions early in the computation significantly reduced the computational burden, allowing it to handle larger and more complex graphs effectively.

            By combining maximum flow techniques with intelligent graph decomposition, CoreExact emerges as a powerful tool for dense subgraph discovery, particularly in the context of large, sparse real-world networks where traditional exact algorithms would otherwise become computationally prohibitive.

            In terms of structural insights into the graphs themselves, the experiments revealed interesting patterns. Biological networks, such as the Yeast dataset, exhibited sparse triangle structures even within regions that were otherwise dense in edges. This reflects a modular organization typical of biological systems, where connections are present but tightly-knit communities (in the sense of high triangle density) are relatively rare. Communication networks, such as AS-733, displayed a contrasting structure, with very high triangle densities, reflecting tightly clustered groups that are common in engineered or infrastructural networks.

            We effectively applied and learned two algorithm, the Exact and CoreExact, to discover dense subgraphs by using network flow techniques. We performed numerous experiments on real-world data sets of varying sizes and structures. We observed that both algorithms discovered the same densest subgraph, but CoreExact was significantly faster than Exact. This indicates that core decomposition and localized search strategies are effective to reduce computation time without compromising accuracy.
