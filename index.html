            This report presents the implementation and performance comparison
            of three different maximal clique detection algorithms:

            <li>Tomita et al.'s Algorithm (2006)</li>
            <li>Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm with Pivoting (1973)</li>
            <li>
              Arboricity-based Clique Algorithm (Recent optimizations using

            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            These algorithms were tested on three real-world graph datasets:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Email-Enron Dataset</strong> - Communication network of
              Enron employees.

              <strong>AS-Skitter Dataset</strong> - Network topology of the
              Internet at the autonomous systems (AS) level.

            The goal of this study is to analyze execution time, the number of
            maximal cliques, and the distribution of clique sizes, while

            Tomita et al. developed an enhanced branch-and-bound method for
            maximal clique detection. Their algorithm incorporates pivoting to
            minimize unnecessary recursive calls, outperforming the traditional
            Bron-Kerbosch method.

          <p class="card-text">
            The process involves selecting a pivot vertex that maximizes overlap
            with potential vertices, and then expanding the clique by
            recursively adding non-neighboring nodes of the pivot. The algorithm
            backtracks when no more candidate vertices are available.

          <p class="card-text">
            The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is a recursive backtracking method for
            finding maximal cliques. We implemented the pivoting version, which
            improves performance by minimizing the number of recursive calls.

            Select a pivot vertex (reduces the branching factor). Recursively
            explore clique extensions by including/excluding vertices. Backtrack
            and prune search space when no further clique extensions exist. This
            algorithm is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency for
            small to medium-sized graphs.

        <h2>Research Paper 3: Arboricity-based Clique Algorithm</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="card-title">Brief Description</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            The Arboricity-based clique enumeration algorithm, developed by
            Chiba and Nishizeki, utilizes a graph's arboricity to efficiently
            find cliques. It systematically scans edges, processing vertices by
            decreasing degree and examining neighbor-induced subgraphs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="card-title">Algorithm Overview</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            The algorithm runs in O(a(G) * m) time per clique, where a(G) is the
            arboricity and m is the number of edges. This approach excels in
            graphs with low arboricity, such as planar or sparse networks,
            outperforming traditional methods. However, it may be less effective
            in dense graphs with high arboricity, like social networks, where
            degeneracy-based methods like Bron-Kerbosch with pivoting might be
            more efficient.
